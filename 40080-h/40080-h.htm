<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>


<p>In the pages which follow only a few of many goods and commodities made,
collected, or grown at or near Jamestown during the seventeenth century
will be discussed. No pretense is made to do more than touch lightly on
the ones mentioned most frequently by the early settlers. With the
exception of tobacco, grape vines, and herbs, agricultural products are
omitted.</p>

<p>Jamestown has never received proper recognition as the place where many
American industries were born in the New World. Few people are aware
that boatbuilding, timbering, glassmaking, tobacco-cultivation,
wine-making, iron-smelting, and the making of pitch, tar, potash and
soap-ashes, were carried on in Virginia's colonial capital; nor is it
generally known that there was production of pottery, bricks and tile,
of considerable volume.</p>

<p>Besides the products mentioned in this booklet, attempts were made to
grow or produce other items at or near "James Citty"&mdash;including cordage,
silk-grass, dyes, salt, flax, hemp, alum, white earth, walnut-oil,
minerals, sweet-gums, madder, sugar cane, cotton, citrus fruits, olives,
bark, roots, and berries. A few brought profits to the planters while
others, like indigo, cotton, sugar cane, and citrus fruits, resulted in
failure. The tropical plants from the West Indies could not, of course,
withstand the cold Virginia winters.</p>

<p>Attempts made by the early planters to find commodities and raw
materials revealed to a large degree the industrial and agricultural
resources of the new colony. The lessons learned at Jamestown&mdash;even
information derived from the failures&mdash;were invaluable ones. For from
the successful activities carried out in the small huts, in the fields,
and in the woodland areas, would later develop industries and
agricultural pursuits undreamed of by the early settlers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> The history of American commodities, like the history of the nation,
is no longer a brief one. Three hundred and fifty years have now passed
since the first adventurous Englishman, with musket in hand and ears
alerted to the sound of moccasined feet, searched the wilderness area up
and down the James River for New World wealth. As time permitted, he
worked in his small shop making utilitarian things out of clay, wood,
sand, and metal&mdash;objects not entirely lacking in beauty. Busy as he was
with these tasks, he still found time to tend his small vineyard and
tobacco field. As he worked he may have dreamed of the day when his
hogs-heads of sweet-scented tobacco and casks of red wine would reach
England safely and be sold for a profit. Trying to better his condition
in a new land, he never dreamed that the seeds of his incessant labors,
which he was unconsciously planting, would some day flower into a great
industrial and agricultural nation.</p>

<h2><a name="BOATBUILDING" id="BOATBUILDING"></a>BOATBUILDING</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span><br /></p>


<p>On April 27 1607, the day after the Jamestown colonists landed at Cape
Henry, some of the settlers began to build or assemble a small boat.
George Percy, one of the original colonists, reported that it was
completed and launched on April 28.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that 350 years ago&mdash;on the sandy beach near Cape
Henry&mdash;the Jamestown bound colonists made their first important
commodity by hand in the New World.</p>

<p>Contemporary records reveal that many small boats were built at
Jamestown from the earliest years of the settlement. They afforded the
best means of transportation through the uncharted wilderness, and were
used for fishing, trade, and exploration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>The conjectural illustration shows colonists building a small boat at
Jamestown Island&mdash;near Back River&mdash;about 1650.</p>

<h2><a name="TIMBERING" id="TIMBERING"></a>TIMBERING</h2>


<p>Timbering was one of the first activities undertaken by the Jamestown
colonists and was one of the first English industries in America. The
day the settlers arrived they began cutting down trees, for timber was
needed to build their fort and town as well as to export to the mother
country. Thomas Studley, a member of the first colony, reported that
clapboards were made for loading on the ships which were to return to
England:</p>

<p>Now falleth every man to worke, the Councell contrive the fort, the rest
cut downe trees to make place to pitch their tents; some provide
clapboard to relade the ships, some make gardens, some nets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Captain Newport left Jamestown in June, 1607 and aboard his two ships
were clapboards and other wooden products.</p>

<p>The virgin forests growing in the vicinity of Jamestown furnished
planks, masts, clapboard, wainscoting, and other wooden products needed
by the mother country. As England had run short of timber and was paying
exorbitant prices to European countries for naval stores and timber
products, the supply furnished by the Jamestown colony helped greatly to
relieve the situation. The Virginians were also helped, for timber was
one of the few products which brought profits to the struggling colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p><p>The conjectural painting shows settlers carrying out timbering
activities at Jamestown. Some of the piled up lumber will be used in the
colony, some will be shipped to England.</p>

<p class="center">(COOPERING)</p>


<p>As early as 1607 barrel staves were made at Jamestown for exporting to
England. Later, when tobacco and other crops were grown
successfully&mdash;and a few commodities were produced in Virginia for
export&mdash;barrels, casks, and other wooden containers were made by the
cooper in large numbers.</p>

<p>John Lewes was the first cooper to reach Jamestown, arriving in January,
1608. Others followed him throughout the seventeenth century; and for
almost a hundred years their craft was an important one in the "Capital
Cittie."</p>

<h2><a name="POTASH_AND_SOAP-ASHES" id="POTASH_AND_SOAP-ASHES"></a>POTASH AND SOAP-ASHES</h2>


<p>Soap-ashes and potash were among the first commodities produced by the
English in America. Potash was made from soap-ashes (wood ashes,
especially those obtained from burning ash and elm) and was used at
Jamestown for making both soap and glass. Soap-ashes were exported to
England as early as 1608, and throughout the remainder of the century it
appears that both potash and soap-ashes were shipped to the mother
country, As early as 1621 soap-ashes were selling for six shillings to
eight shillings per hundred weight, whereas potash was bringing between
thirty-five shillings and forty shillings per hundred weight.</p>

<p>Although few contemporary records are available which mention the profit
made from the sale of soap-ashes and potash by the Virginia planters, it
is known that some small returns were made from time to time throughout
the seventeenth century. While tobacco was the important money-making
crop, the part played in the economy of the Jamestown settlement and
environs by other commodities&mdash;including soap-ashes and potash&mdash;should
not be overlooked.</p>

<p>In the conjectural picture Jamestown settlers are shown making potash.
Five steps were necessary:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">1. A pile of firewood (billet-wood) was burned until grey ashes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">were formed. The best woods were oak, ash, poplar, hickory, elm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">hazel, and beech. Old hollow trees, if not dead, were especially</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">desirable.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">2. After several pounds of ashes had accumulated, they were leached</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(boiling water was percolated through the ashes), resulting in a</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">very strong alkali solution known as ley or lye.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">3. The alkali solution (or ley) was strained through a coarse linen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">cloth to keep out any coarse materials (such as small pieces of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">half-burnt wood), that might happen to remain in the ashes.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">4. The strained ley solution was poured in an iron pan, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">evaporated over a quick fire&mdash;almost to dryness.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">5. The residue remaining in the bottom of the pan was removed and put</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">into an iron pot. The pot was put over a strong fire till the matter was</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">melted. Immediately the melted matter was poured out upon an iron plate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">where it soon cooled and appeared in the form of a solid lump of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">potash.</span><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>To a chemist the somewhat primitive methods described are very obvious
ones in making an impure form of potash. The combustion of hardwoods
resulted in an ash residue containing the desired potassium carbonate.
Some purification was obtained by leaching the ash residue in boiling
water and then filtering the "ley" through a coarse linen cloth. The
filtered "ley" was evaporated in an iron pot to dryness. The potash
resulting was now ready for making soap and glass, as well as for other
industrial uses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="PITCH_AND_TAR" id="PITCH_AND_TAR"></a>PITCH AND TAR</h2>


<p>Pitch and tar&mdash;used by shipbuilders from time immemorial for caulking
and covering seams of vessels&mdash;were made at Jamestown as early as 1608.
After the second supply ships reached Jamestown in October, 1608, one of
the settlers wrote:</p>

<p>No sooner were we landed, but the President dispersed [as] many as were
able, some for glasse, others for pitch, tarre, and sope ashes.</p>

<p>A month later trials of pitch and tar were carried to England by Captain
Christopher Newport, as reported by Thomas Studley, one of the original
planters:</p>

<p>Captaine Newport being dispatched with the tryals of pitch, tarre,
glass, frankincense and sope ashes, with that clapbord and wainscot
[which] could bee provided ... returned for England.</p>

<p>As pitch and tar were made in Virginia throughout the seventeenth
century, mainly for exporting to England, it appears that the colonists
made some profit from the sale of such products.</p>

<p>Pitch and tar were obtained from pine trees, one of the common trees in
the Tidewater Virginia woods. Tar is an oily, dark colored, product
obtained in the destructive distillation of pine wood. In Virginia it
was commonly made from the resinous roots and wood of various pines. The
wood was heaped into a conical stack depressed at the center, covered
with earth, and fired. The tar ran into a hollowed-out place in the soil
beneath the stack of wood. Pitch was a dark-colored viscous substance
obtained as a residue in distilling pine tar, and widely used for
caulking seams of boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p><p>It is of interest that the early settlers named the large swamp north
of the town area "Pitch and Tar Swamp." Undoubtedly the large pine trees
which bordered the swamp were used for making pitch and tar, as well as
turpentine and resin.</p>

<h2><a name="IRON" id="IRON"></a>IRON</h2>


<p>It is possible that small amounts of iron were smelted at Jamestown in
earth ovens or Catalan-type furnaces during the early years of the
colony. In 1955 archeologists unearthed a circular-shaped pit which
contained charcoal, burned oyster shell, iron ore, pieces of smelted
iron, and slag. It is known that some iron was made in earth ovens in
England during the early years of the seventeenth century, where iron
was smelted in holes dug in the ground. The fires were fed with logs and
charcoal, and the heat was increased by use of large foot bellows. The
same method may have been used at Jamestown; or it is possible that the
"earth oven" may have been used for hardening bar iron imported from
England, as much bar iron received from the mother country was very soft
and unsatisfactory for making tools.</p>

<h2><a name="A_JAMESTOWN_BLACKSMITH_SHOP" id="A_JAMESTOWN_BLACKSMITH_SHOP"></a>A JAMESTOWN BLACKSMITH SHOP</h2>


<p>A blacksmith, James Read by name, was a member of the first group of
colonists who planted the Jamestown settlement in 1607. Perhaps he
helped forge the small chisels which Captain John Smith mentioned
(writing of the month of September, 1607):</p>

<p>As yet we have no houses to cover us, our tents were rotten, and our
cabbins worse than nought: our best commoditie was iron which we made
into little chissels.</p>

<p>Many small chisels have been unearthed at Jamestown, and one may wonder
whether any were made during the hard autumn of 1607, when the state of
the new colony was at such a low ebb.</p>

<p>Another early Jamestown blacksmith was Richard Dole, who arrived on the
supply ship <i>Phoenix</i>, April 20 1608. Read and Dole were the vanguards
of many ironworkers who emigrated to Virginia at various periods of time
throughout the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1955 archeologists discovered the site of an early seventeenth
century forge or smithery near historic Jamestown church. Large
quantities of slag were unearthed together with pieces of bar iron,
weapons, tool fragments, and several partially-completed iron handles,
chisels, and nails. A few blacksmiths' tools and a small anvil were also
found. Associated cultural material found indicated that the forge
operated between 1610 and 1625, and there was good evidence that it may
have been located in an armourer's shop. The forge site appears to be
the oldest one used by the English which has been discovered in America.</p>

In 1620-21 the Jamestown colonists established an iron furnace at
Falling Creek&mdash;about eighty miles upriver from Jamestown. It was
the first ironworks built in America by Englishmen, and the furnace was
the first one (of which there is definite record) in which iron was
smelted. The contemporary records also indicate that a few tools were
made in the forge shop. The enterprise was short-lived, however, for in
1622 the Indians massacred the ironworkers and their families and
destroyed the furnace. Although never rebuilt, its importance cannot be
overstressed, for the Falling Creek site can rightfully claim the honor
of being the birthplace of the American iron industry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GLASSMAKING" id="GLASSMAKING"></a>GLASSMAKING</h2>


<p>Glass was made at Jamestown in 1608-1609, and again in 1621-1624, its
manufacture being one of the first English industries in the New World.</p>

<p>Among the colonists who reached Jamestown in October, 1608, were "eight
Dutchmen and Poles," some of whom were glassmakers. When Captain
Christopher Newport sailed for England a few weeks later he carried with
him "tryals of pitch, tarre, glasse, frankincense, sope ashes; with that
clapboard and waynscot that could be provided." It is not known what
kinds of glass were taken to England by Newport. John Smith, writing of
the year 1609, stated: "... wee made three or foure lotts of tarre,
pitch, and sope ashes; produced a tryall of glass...." Again, the
records do not reveal what kinds of glass were produced.</p>

<p>In 1621 six Italian glassmakers arrived at Jamestown, and during the
next three years attempts were made to manufacture glass, but it appears
that only small amounts were blown.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, archeological excavations did not disclose what kinds of
glass were made at Jamestown during the two ventures. When the
glasshouse site was excavated in 1948 only small fragments and
drippings&mdash;dark green in color&mdash;were found. It appears that
the tiny fragments could have been pieces from window panes, bottles and
vials, and simple drinking glasses. No glass beads were found at or near
the furnace site.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p><p>The conjectural sketch shows a Jamestown glassblower at work.</p>

<h2><a name="FURS_AND_HIDES" id="FURS_AND_HIDES"></a>FURS AND HIDES</h2>


<p>Shortly after the Jamestown colony was planted the English adventurers
explored the rivers and bays in the vicinity of the settlement, visited
many Indian villages, and traded colorful articles to the natives in
exchange for foods, furs, and other commodities.</p>

<p>The first exploring party left Jamestown a week after the establishment
of the colony. Twenty-four of the settlers sailed up the James River as
far as the falls, a distance of about ninety miles. At Arahatteak (near
present-day Richmond) the explorers gave the Indians "penny knyves,
sheeres, belles, beades, glass toyes &amp;c ..." for mulberries, wheat,
beans, tobacco, and a "crowne which was of deares hayre, dyed redd."
Before leaving the village Captain Newport presented the Indian chief
with a hatchet and a red waistcoat.</p>

<p>On the return trip to Jamestown the exploring party visited other Indian
towns on the James River, including one whose chieftain was Powhatan's
brother&mdash;the wily and crafty Opechancanough. Gabriel Archer, a member of
the group, recorded that the chief's "kyngdome is full of deare (so also
is most of all the kyngdomes:) he hath (as the rest likewise) many ryche
furres."</p>

<p>Many of the early settlers listed the fur-bearing animals that inhabited
the dense woods near Jamestown. George Percy, an original planter,
observed that:</p>

<p>There is also great store of deere both red and fallow. There are
beares, foxes, otters, bevers, muskats, and wild beasts unknowne.</p>

<p>John Smith, in one of his early books describing Virginia (<i>A Map of
Virginia, With a Description of the Country</i>, Oxford, 1612), gives brief
descriptions of deer, squirrels, opossums, muskrats, bears, beavers,
otters, foxes, and others. With the exception <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> of bears, these
fur-bearing animals still inhabit Jamestown Island&mdash;protected by the
National Park Service.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Conjectural sketch</i></p></div>
<p><br /></p>
<p class="center">For inexpensive beads and trinkets the colonists received furs, foods,
and other commodities from the aborigines.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that early in the century some profit was being made from the
sale of furs in England, for Thomas Studley, who was in charge of the
first storehouse at Jamestown, wrote that "one mariner in one voyage
hath got so many [furs] as he confessed to have solde in England for
£30."</p>

<p>William Strachey, who lived at Jamestown in 1610-1611, described a
trading expedition made by Captain Samuel Argall in 1610:</p>

<p>Within this river, Captayne Samuell Argoll in a smale river which the
Indians call <i>Oquiho</i>. Anno 1610. trading (in a bark called the
Discovery) for corne, with the great king of <i>Patawomeck</i>, from him
obteyned well neere 400. bushells of wheat, pease and beanes (besyde
many kind of furrs) for 9. powndes of copper, 4. bunches of beades, 8
dozen of hatchetts, 5 dozen of knives, 4 bunches of bells, 1. dozen
Sizers, all not much more worth than 40<i>s.</i> English....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p><p>It is evident, therefore, that the Jamestown colonists who traded their
colorful beads and trinkets to the woodland Indians in exchange for food
and other commodities&mdash;including furs and hides&mdash;were the pioneer
English fur traders in the New World. The experiences which adventurers
like Christopher Newport, John Smith, and Samuel Argall had with the
cunning Virginia aborigines were just as exciting and stirring as those
shared by the hardened trappers and traders who searched the Rocky
Mountain streams for beaver two hundred years later. The hunt for furs
which began at Jamestown in 1607 did not diminish until the western
boundary of the United States had expanded to the shores of the Pacific
Ocean during the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h2><a name="BUILDING" id="BUILDING"></a>BUILDING</h2>


<p>The day the colonists landed at Jamestown, May 14 1607, they began
building a triangular-shaped fort ("a pallizado of planckes and strong
posts, foure foote deepe in the ground, of yong oakes, walnuts, &amp;c."), "a
setled streete of houses," a church, a guardhouse, and a storehouse. It
is apparent that all men familiar with tools and building skills were
extremely busy during the first few weeks, especially the four
carpenters in the group (William Laxon, Edward Pising, Thomas Emry, and
Robert Small), two bricklayers (John Herd and William Garret), and mason
(Edward Brinto). As brick houses were not built at Jamestown until about
1625, the bricklayers who came to Virginia with the first group of
colonists undoubtedly aided the carpenters. Perhaps it was they who made
the first stone footings and mud and stick chimneys for the frame houses
which were built inside the fort.</p>

<p>As timber was plentiful in Virginia during the early years of the
settlement, most of the houses were of frame construction. During the
first decade or two house construction reflected a primitive use, not of
materials brought from England but those that were found ready at hand,
such as saplings for a sort of framing, use of branches, leafage, bark
and animal skins. During these early years, when the settlers were
having a difficult time staying alive, mud walls, wattle and daub, and
marsh grass thatch of a coarse sort were used. Out of these years of
improvising the construction with squared posts, later with quarterings
(studs), came into practice. There probably was little thought of
plastering walls during the first two decades, and when it was done,
clay, or clay mixed with oyster shell lime, was first used. The early
floors were of clay, and it should be remembered that clay floors
continued to be used in the humbler dwellings throughout the seventeenth
century. It can be assumed that most of the dwellings, or shelters, of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the Jamestown settlers, certainly until about 1630, had the primitive
appearance of "settlers" houses, and were rough on the exterior.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Conjectural Painting</i><br /></p></div><hr class="chap" />

<p>The frame house shown is believed to be typical of many built by the
yeomen settlers after 1630. A coarse marsh grass thatch covers the roof
and rough clapboards cover the sides of the building. The few casement
windows used have diamond-shaped panes, and heavy wooden doors swing on
hand wrought iron strap hinges. In the foreground is a large brick
chimney, oven, and woodshed. The shed and recessed nook in front of the
oven are covered with red earthenware pantiles. Jamestown has taken on a
degree of permanency, and many of the Colonists are realizing small
profits from the sale of tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>After the settlement had become fairly well established the colonists
began building a few brick houses. In the picture English artisans are
shown erecting a small brick structure at Jamestown about the year 1630.
It is quite clear from the documentary records and the archeological
remains that the colonists not only made their own bricks&mdash;and probably
many of their roofing tiles&mdash;but that the process, as well as the
finished product, followed closely the English tradition.</p>

<p>An old account, relating to brick-making in England three hundred years
ago, is summarized:</p>

<p>1. Before Christmas we begin to dig the earth and let it lie to mellow
till Easter.</p>

<p>2. Then we water the earth well and temper it with a narrow spade.</p>

<p>3. The moulder cuts off a piece of earth, throws it into the mould made
of beech, levelling it off with a wooden implement called a strike.</p>

<p>4. The carrier carries the mould to the drying ground, where he adroitly
turns it over, laying the bricks on the ground, and lifts up the mould.</p>

<p>5. When the bricks are dry, they carry them to a place where they row
them up like a wall. They are covered with straw, till they are dry
enough to be carried to the kiln.</p>

<p>6. Then they are stacked in the kiln, a fire kept till they are at the
top red fire hot.</p>

<p>7. Then we let them cool, and sell them as we can for as much money as
we can get, but usually about 13 or 14 shillings the thousand.</p>

<p class="center">Overall View Of Brick Kiln Unearthed at Jamestown</p>

In addition to bricks, flat roofing tiles were found in this
kiln&mdash;placed there for firing with the bricks. Four brick kilns were
discovered at Jamestown during archeological explorations.</div><hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to build brick houses lime was needed by the bricklayers and
plasterers for making plaster and mortar. Contemporary records reveal
that "lymeburners" emigrated to Jamestown as early as 1610. As four lime
kilns were found during archeological excavations, it is evident that
the lime used by the Jamestown builders was made on the historic island.
In the kilns oyster shells from the James River were burned and
converted into lime by the limeburners.</p>

<p>The unearthing of large quantities of plaster and mortar at Jamestown
indicates that the majority of the brick houses (as well as many frame
structures) had plastered walls and ceilings, especially after 1635.
Some plaster excavated had been white-washed while other bore its
natural whitish-gray color. All plaster and mortar found was made from
oyster shell lime, sand, and clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p><p>Ornamental or decorative plaster was found near a few of the house
foundations. The plasterwork, decorated in raised ornamental designs,
was used for enhancing the beauty of both the interior and exterior of a
building. Designs on the plaster included Roman numerals, letters,
mottos, crests, veined leaves, rosettes, geometric patterns, a lion, and
a face or mask. Many fragments of moulded plaster cornices were also
recovered. Broken oyster shells are distinguishable in the ornamental
plasterwork, indicating that the pargetting was made at Jamestown.</p>

<h2><a name="TOBACCO" id="TOBACCO"></a>TOBACCO</h2>


<p>When Jamestown was established in 1607 the Indians living in Tidewater
Virginia were smoking a leaf from the native tobacco plant, <i>Nicotiana
rustica</i>. It was a bitter tasting leaf of rather poor quality, and never
cultivated on a large scale by the early planters.</p>

<p>About 1611, seeds of a West Indies tobacco plant, <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>,
were introduced into Virginia. A year later John Rolfe experimented with
the seeds from the West Indies plant, together with tobacco seeds from
South America. The exact nature of Rolfe's tests, carried on at or near
Jamestown, is unknown, but the plant he seemingly developed was one with
a mild, sweet-scented, leaf.</p>

<p>The new sweet-scented leaf became popular overnight, and during the
remainder of the seventeenth century it proved the economic salvation of
the colony. To a large degree, the new crop determined the economic,
social, and political life of the planters. The demand in England for
the new leaf was also responsible, in a large measure, for the spread of
settlement and increase of population in Virginia. The tobacco plant
developed by Rolfe was the first crop grown by the Virginia settlers
which made a profit.</p>

<h2><a name="WINE" id="WINE"></a>WINE</h2>


<p>During the early years of the Jamestown settlement the Virginia Company
of London encouraged many agricultural pursuits, including the planting
and cultivation of grape vines and the making of wine. The reasons
seemed to have been twofold: first, to make money for the Virginia
Company, whose stock-holders had invested much capital in the new
colony; and secondly, to insure the mother country a steady flow of
inexpensive wine&mdash;which was impossible as long as continental merchants
charged exorbitant prices for wines sent to England. Then, too, if wine
could be made successfully in Virginia, the people living in the new
settlement would profit accordingly.</p>

<p>Vineyards were planted on Jamestown Island at various periods of time
during the seventeenth century, and quantities of good wines were made,
but far too often inferior wine was fermented. Because of the long sea
journey from Virginia, casks of good wine sent to England frequently
arrived in a spoiled condition.</p>

<p>After 1675 the hope of producing good Virginia wine for export purposes
waned. During the last ten years of the century, when Jamestown
declined, the vineyards were neglected, fell prey to deer and the
elements, and soon became engulfed in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Wine was a popular beverage in Virginia during the seventeenth century.
A few items unearthed at Jamestown which relate to wine consumption are
shown: a wine bottle, wine glass, glass bottle seals (which were
attached to the shoulders of many wine bottles), a bronze spigot, and
wooden barrel staves. In 1610 Francisco Maguel, who had spent eight
months in Virginia, wrote that "There grow in that country [Virginia]
wild many forest grapes, of which the English make a wine that resembles
much the wine of Alicante, according to the opinion of the narrator who
has tasted both." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SILK" id="SILK"></a>SILK</h2>


<p>During the early years of the seventeenth century England was paying
exorbitant prices for silk. Most of it was purchased from the
Mediterranean countries&mdash;France, Italy, and Spain. Some was imported
from the Near East, and small amounts from the Orient were bought from
Dutch sea captains. As extremely high prices were being paid for the
precious cloth, the Virginia Company decided to experiment with silk
culture in the new colony.</p>

<p>Silk was made at Jamestown during the seventeenth century, but the
enterprise seldom brought profit to the planters. The majority of the
colonists had to struggle to grow crops and produce goods with which
they were familiar, and were reluctant to experiment with a commodity
which required a special skill that they did not possess. A few
settlers, however, made serious efforts to raise silkworms, and at times
small quantities of silk were made and shipped to England.</p>

<p>The silk-making venture died a hard death, but the large mulberry trees
which still grow in many places in Tidewater Virginia (perhaps scions of
seventeenth century ones) are reminders of a day when a few Virginia
colonists fed and nurtured silkworms and "wound off" silk thread onto
primitive wooden reels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p><p>In the conjectural illustration a woman is drawing silk thread from the

<h2><a name="POTTERY" id="POTTERY"></a>POTTERY</h2>


<p>There is definite evidence that pottery was made at Jamestown over 300
years ago. A kiln site was uncovered in 1955, and nearby were found
overfired pots, misshaped vessels, and mis-glazed pieces&mdash;undoubtedly
from the "waster" pile. Also found near the kiln site were two complete
pots, and hundreds of fragments from local-made vessels which were used
in the colony between 1625 and 1650&mdash;indisputable evidence that crude,
utilitarian, lead-glazed earthenware was made at Jamestown during the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Although made for everyday use, many of the pieces unearthed at the
Jamestown kiln site are symmetrical in form and not entirely lacking in
beauty. One can easily see that the craftsman took pride in shaping the
pieces, as three centuries later the crude wares are still pleasing to
behold.</p>

<p>The Jamestown potter, indeed, was no young apprentice or mere farmer who
potted on the side. The potter's art, then as now, was a highly
specialized one, rooted in a long tradition. Our potter was an artisan,
trained in the mysteries of a medieval craft, and it was probably he who
first transplanted his ancient skills to the Virginia wilderness.</p>

<h2><a name="METALWORKING" id="METALWORKING"></a>METALWORKING</h2>


<p>As early as 1608 two goldsmiths&mdash;William Johnson and Richard
Belfield&mdash;emigrated to Jamestown. With them were two refiners and a
jeweler. Although John Smith wrote that these artisans "never had
occasion to exercise their craft," it is possible that they made a few
small objects of silver, pewter, and latten metal (a brass-like alloy).</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that few specimens of silver and pewter were found
at Jamestown, seventeenth century records and inventories indicate that
many Virginia families owned such wares, including cups, beakers,
dishes, salts, salvers, tankards, porringers, bowls, and plates.</p>

<p>A pewterer who lived thirty miles from Jamestown&mdash;Joseph Copeland
by name&mdash;made the oldest dated piece of American pewter which has
been found. In the 1930's, National Park Service archeologists, working
at Jamestown, recovered the significant specimen&mdash;an incomplete
pewter spoon which is a variant of the trifid or split-end type common
during the 1650-1690 period. Impressed on the handle, in the trefoil
finial of the stem is the mark of the maker, giving his name, the
Virginia town where he worked, and the year he started business. The
matchless spoon bears the sole surviving "touch" or mark of an American
pewterer of the seventeenth century. The complete legend, encircling a
heart, reads: "IOSEPH COPELAND/1675/CHUCKATUCK." (Chuckatuck is a small
Virginia village located about thirty miles southeast of Jamestown.)
Copeland later moved to Jamestown, and as he worked in the statehouse
from 1688-1691 he may have made pewter in Virginia's capital "Citty."</p>

<p>The rather commonplace and incomplete spoon fragment illustrated is
significant for many reasons. Its prime importance is that it is the
oldest known pewter object of American manufacture. The mark on the
handle is the sole surviving one of an American pewterer of the
seventeenth century. The mark reveals that the spoon was made in 1675 by
Joseph Copeland, who worked at Chuckatuck, Virginia (located thirty
miles southeast of Jamestown).</p></div>

were unearthed at Jamestown, are reminders of a bygone day when
metalworkers made beautiful things in Virginia's colonial capital over

<h2><a name="FISHING" id="FISHING"></a>FISHING</h2>


<p>When the first settlers planted their small colony at Jamestown the
tidewater rivers and bays teemed with many kinds of fish and seafood.
Varieties which soon appeared on the colonists' tables included
sheepshead, shad, sturgeon, herring, sole, white salmon, bass, flounder,
pike, bream, perch, rock, and drum; as well as oysters, crabs, and
mussels.</p>

<p>The day after the colonists reached Virginia, April 27 1607, George
Percy observed that the oysters were large and tasty:</p>

<p>We came to a place where they [the Indians] had made a great fire, and
had beene newly a rosting oysters. When they perceived our comming, they
fled away to the mountaines, and left many of the oysters in the fire.
We eat some of the oysters, which were very large and delicate in taste.</p>

<p>The following day, April 28, Percy noted that some of the oysters had
pearls:</p>

<p> ... we got good store of mussels and oysters, which lay on the ground as
thicke as stones. Wee opened some, and found in many of them pearles.</p>

<p>The Jamestown planters who wrote accounts of the new colony commented on
the abundance and variety of fish and shellfish in the rivers and creeks
near the "capital citty." It seems rather surprising, therefore, that so
many colonists died during the first autumn "of meere famine," as
reported by Percy, when the James River teemed with fish, oysters, and
crabs.</p>

<p>Captain Gabriel Archer, Gentleman, mentioned a seven foot sturgeon which
was caught on June 13 1607: "Our Admiralls men gatt a sturgeon of 7
foote long which Captayne Newport gave us." George Percy commented on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the excellence of the sturgeon in the James River:</p>

<p>The artifacts shown were excavated at Jamestown. These objects and many
others found, are reminders of a day when fish and shellfish lived in
abundance in every creek, river, and bay, in Tidewater Virginia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many branches of this river, which runne flowing through the
woods with great plentie of fish of all kindes; as for sturgeon, all the
world cannot be compared to it....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p><p>John Smith and William Strachey also listed the delicious and palatable
varieties of fish and shellfish which were found in Virginia waters,

colonists. At times, especially during the early years, it was one of
the main sources.</p>

<h2><a name="BREWING" id="BREWING"></a>BREWING</h2>


<p>One seventeenth century building unearthed at Jamestown appears to have
been used as a place where beer, ale, brandy, and other alcoholic
beverages were made. Nearby were found pieces of lead, which may have
been part of a lead cistern which held barley, and inside the building
were three brick ovens, which may have been used for drying malt. A
handle from a copper kettle was discovered near one of the ovens, and
pieces of copper and lead pipes were recovered not far from the
building. Historical objects excavated near the site revealed that the
structure was used between 1625 and 1660.</p>

<p>A 1685 account relating to brewing could very well refer to a Jamestown
establishment where beer and other beverages were made nearly 300 years
ago:</p>

<p>Where wine is not to be had they drink beer, which is brewed of malt and
hops, in a caldron. Afterwards it is powred into vatts, and when it is
cold, it is carried in soes [wooden pails], into the cellar and is put
into vessels.</p>

<h2><a name="HERBS_AND_MEDICINAL_PLANTS" id="HERBS_AND_MEDICINAL_PLANTS"></a>HERBS AND MEDICINAL PLANTS</h2>


<p>Among commodities which the early Jamestown settlers searched for were
herbs and medicinal plants. It is possible that Thomas Wotton and Will
Wilkinson, surgeons with the first colony, were the first members of the
English medical profession to collect and experiment with New World
plants.</p>

<p>The few colonists who wrote of their travels in Virginia frequently made
mention of the herbs and native plants. George Percy related that five
days after the settlers had planted their colony at Jamestown, May 19,
1607, that "One of the savages brought us on the way to the wood-side,
where there was a garden of tobacco and other fruits and herbes."</p>

<p>On an exploring trip upriver from Jamestown in late May, 1607, Gabriel
Archer recorded that "One [savage] shewed us the herbe called in their
tongue <i>wisacan</i>, which they say heales poysoned woundes, it is like
lyverwort or bloudwort."</p>

<p>John Smith mentioned the spring herbs, though he did not know their
names: "Many <i>hearbes</i> in the spring time there are common dispersed
throughout the woods, good for brothes and sallets, as violets, purslin,
sorrell, &amp;c. Besides many we used whose names we know not."</p>

<p>The first supply, approximately 120 settlers, reached Jamestown in
midwinter and early spring, 1608. Among the group was a physician, Dr.
Walter Russell; a surgeon, Post Ginnatt; and two apothecaries, Thomas
Feld and John Harford. There is no record, however, indicating that
these men used Virginia plants and herbs for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>The man who first made intensive experiments with native plants was
Doctor Lawrence Bohun. Arriving at Jamestown in 1610, he is mentioned
several times by William Strachey, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> also reached Jamestown in 1610,
in <i>The Historie of Travell into Virginia Britania 1612</i>:</p>

dissentericall fluxes of which Doctor Bohoune made open experiment in
many of our men labouring with such diseases and therefore wisheth all
such phisitians as shall goe thither to make use thereof.</p>

<p>As early as 1610 the Virginia Company of London instructed the colonists
to send the following plants to England: sassafras, bayberries, "poccone
to be gotten from the Indians," "galbrand [galbanum] groweth like
fennell," sarsaparilla, and walnut oil. Other plants, both native and
exotic, which were cultivated at Jamestown for medicinal purposes
included mastic, woodbine, senna, snakeroot, dittany, mechoacan,
pepper-wort, Jamestown (or Jimson) weed, wild cherry, and rhubarb.</p>

<p>Most of the herbs which were cultivated in English gardens grew
successfully in Virginia, especially the ones listed in John Gerard's
<i>The Herbal</i> (London, 1597), and William Lawson's <i>The Country
Housewifes Garden</i> (London, 1617). Many contemporary records reveal that
several herbs were used for medicinal purposes as well as for improving
the flavor of certain foods and beverages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p><p>A few herbs still grow on Jamestown Island, and together with the
native sassafras, bayberry, wild bergamot, and bee balm, they remind us

<h2><a name="FURNITURE" id="FURNITURE"></a>FURNITURE</h2>


<p>Virginia in the seventeenth century was a woodsman's paradise, and there
is every reason to believe that most of the furniture used in Jamestown
houses was made by colonial cabinetmakers. In the forests grew
magnificent specimens of oak, walnut, pine, cypress, cedar, maple, and
many other varieties; and although contemporary records are scanty, it
is believed that the "James Citty" furniture makers made skillful use of
such woods. William Strachey, who reached Jamestown in 1610, wrote that
the church furniture was made of cedar and black walnut:</p>

<p>It [the church] is in length threescore foote, in breadth twenty foure,
and shall have a chancell in it of cedar, and a communion table of blake
walnut, and all the pewes of cedar, ... a pulpet of the same, with a
font hewen hollow, like a canoa....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p><p>In spite of the fact that few records exist regarding the kinds of
furniture made in the seventeenth century by Virginia cabinetmakers, the
pieces extant reveal that the English styles were followed closely.
While it is true that the wealthy planters imported some ornamented
furniture from London, much of their furniture was made on the
plantations. It is believed that practically all furniture used by the
yeomen settlers was locally made.</p>

<p>The earthenware baking oven shown was restored from over 200 fragments
found during archeological excavations at Jamestown. In use, heated
stones were placed inside and left until the walls of the oven were hot
enough for baking. Sometimes the oven was placed directly on the embers.
With the small thick door in place, heat was retained for considerable
time&mdash;the domed top reflecting the heat down on the bread or cakes that
were being baked.</p>

<p>Although not a commodity in the strict sense of the word, an icehouse
was indispensable in preserving certain products. Archeological
explorations at Jamestown revealed that icehouses were built on the
island over 300 years ago. Ice was &quot;harvested&quot; during the winter months,
and often remained in storage as late as September or October. It was
used for cooling bottled wines, &quot;firming&quot; butter, and keeping fresh
certain foods, such as fish, meats, and dairy products. In the
illustration men are carrying ice to the circular-shaped, brick,
icehouse. In the distance a man is sawing ice.</p>

<p>The early Jamestown settlers were self-sufficient to a large degree when
they arrived in the New World, and so they remained. Cut off from
communication with the mother country for long periods of time, they had
to rely upon their own resources. If they needed a thing they usually
had to make it with their own hands or do without. These homemade
objects&mdash;including cloth, pottery, tools, woodenware, furniture,
brick and tiles, and many household accessories&mdash;were well-made and
extremely practical. Many items made in the home were not entirely
lacking in beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
